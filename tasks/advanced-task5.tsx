// Spatial-Temporal Reasoning Task
// Key components:
// - Present a sequence of spatial transformations (e.g., rotations, reflections)
// - Ask user to predict final state or intermediate states
// - Increase number and complexity of transformations in later rounds
// - Include both 2D and 3D spatial reasoning challenges
