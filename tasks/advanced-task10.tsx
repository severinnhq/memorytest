// Cognitive Flexibility and Set-Shifting Challenge
// Key components:
// - Present tasks requiring frequent shifts between cognitive sets
// - Include multiple task types (e.g., sorting by color, shape, size)
// - Measure speed and accuracy of set shifts
// - Increase frequency and complexity of required shifts in later rounds
